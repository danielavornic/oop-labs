# Laboratory 0

## Task

Create a class in a language and editor of your choice (Java, Python, C++, C#) that:

- Stores information about the object (to represent an object’s state - moving/standing, its speed or color);

- Has a method for informing the user of it’s state (printing it’s state to the console).

## Challenge

### 1. Abbreviate the name

We have a class User with two fields: firstName and lastName of type String.
The client asked us to display the initials at the bottom of a business-related document, so we need to create a method inside User class that will convert:

Ion Doe -> I. D.
Miley Cyrus -> M. C.
